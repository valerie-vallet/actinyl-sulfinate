2EDM Note:
---------
For post-HF, natural orbital "wavefunctions" the Muller approximation
of the two-electron density matrix (2EDM) in terms of natural orbitals
of the one-electron density matrix (1EDM) is used to calculate 2EDM-
dependent properties (i.e., Vee contributions and electronic localization
and delocalization properties).  For HF single-determinant wavefunctions the
expression used for the 2EDM is exact.

DFT Note:
--------
VeeX represents the exchange-correlation functional for the wavefunction's
underlying model.  For Hartree-Fock wavefunctions, VeeX is the two-electron
Hartree-Fock exchange functional.  For wavefunctions of supported DFT models
(currently LSDA, B3LYP and M062X), VeeX is the actual exchange-correlation functional
of the corresponding DFT model and atomic contributions VeeX(A) to VeeX are
explicitly calculated and unambiguous.  However, since VeeX is at least partly
just a one-electron functional for DFT models, the partitioning of VeeX(A)
into interatomic (VeeX(A,B) and VeeX(A,A')) and intraatomic (VeeX(A,A))
contributions is ambiguous.  Currently, interatomic contributions VeeX(A,B)
and VeeX(A,A') are calculated using the Hartree-Fock exchange functional while
the intratomic contribution VeeX(A,A) is calculated as VeeX(A) - VeeX(A,A').
For wavefunctions of non-supported DFT models, VeeX is (incorrectly) assumed
to be the Hartree-Fock exchange functional and the atomic energies E_IQA(A)
will not be correct and will not sum to the correct molecular energy.
